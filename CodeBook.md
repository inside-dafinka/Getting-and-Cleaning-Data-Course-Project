## Code Book

The code book describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the data. 

## Sources

The activity labels were loaded from the 'activity_labels.txt' file.

### Activity Labels

* `WALKING` (value `1`): subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value `2`): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject was laying down during the test

The features were loaded from the 'features.txt' file.

### Training Set

The subjects from the training set, performing the test, were loaded from 'train/subject_train.txt'.
The feature measurements for the training set were loaded from 'train/X_train.txt'.
The activities performed during the measurements were loaded from 'train/y_train.txt'.

### Test Set

The subjects from the test set, performing the test, were loaded from 'test/subject_test.txt'.
The feature measurements for the test set were loaded from 'test/X_test.txt'.
The activities performed during the measurements were loaded from 'test/y_test.txt'.

After the run_analysis.R script was executed, the merged and cleaned data was saved to the tidy.txt file. 
The full data set contains the following features:


* `Subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `Activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
